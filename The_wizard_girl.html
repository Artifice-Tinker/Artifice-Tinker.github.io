			<p>Once upon a time, there was a kingdom. It was a wonderful kingdom, rich and beautiful. Everyone had warm houses and good food. They were protected by valiant knights and powerful wizards, and could live their lives to the fullest.
			<br>
			<p>The kingdom was so wonderful that all its people made a wish, that they could enjoy the goodness of the kingdom forever.
			<br>
			<p>And so seasons passed.
			<br>
			<p>In this kingdom was a young girl who had some magical talent. Her parents were simple farmers, but they were so proud of her, that they nurtured her talent at every opportunity. They were certain that she would become a great wizard one day, and keep the kingdom safe.
			<br>
			<p>They so wanted her to be the best that she could be, that they sent her off to a wizards tower, to learn, though it hurt them greatly that she would not be with them. The girl studied hard and learned from the ghosts of the many old, wise wizards who had made the kingdom great.
			<br>
			<p>And so seasons passed.
			<br>
			<p>The girl learned quite a lot. She was not the most powerful, nor the most knowledgeable of the students of the tower, but she was still quite skilled in her own right. But when the time came to leave the tower, she hesitated. 
			<br>
			<p>She wanted to protect the kingdom, to be a hero, but she was not powerful enough to journey out on her own, as great mages had in the past. And she did not know anyone who would  adventure alongside her, who could guard her from danger as she crafted her spells in combat. The only people she knew were other wizards, none of whom were known for their durability.
			<br>
			<p>Conflicted, she asked her teachers for their guidance.
			<br>
			<p>"You are too weak to be a hero", said the ghosts, "but the kingdom always needs magic. Someone needs to keep the ritual going after all. Someone needs to keep the dead alive."
			<br>
			<p>One of them took her deep underneath the tower, and beneath was a spacious room, covered floor to ceiling with gilded circles and runes etched with crystal. Other wizards milled around checking over the carvings and equipment, preparing for the next casting of the ritual.
			<br>
			<p>In the center sat a giant caged bird, wreathed in flame; it's feathers missing in patches, with scaly skin beneath; it's eyes wild and angry, it's pupils slit like a dragon's.
			<br>
			<p>"While it is caged like that, the phoenix is not dangerous, and magic channeled though it by the runes becomes rejuvenating," her teacher said, "Do not worry for the beast though, we take the best care of it. We would not want *it* to die either, yes?"
			<br>
			<p>Her teacher showed her where to stand and, in time with the other acolytes, how to pour her magic into the ritual. But this spell was unlike what she had been trained to cast before. She felt lost in it's power and in the flow of casting a spell with others, and before she knew it, the spell had drained her dry.
			<br>
			<p>"Do not worry", said the wizards, "You will get used to it. And once you do, think of how much stronger you'll be."
			<br>
			<p>And she did get used to it, as seasons passed. But she did not get stronger. Instead she got weaker. And weaker. And weaker still.
			<br>
			<p>"This is okay", she eventually decided, "I wanted to be a hero. A hero sacrifices herself for others. For the kingdom. I am a hero."
			<br>
			<p>"I am a hero," she thought as her parents passed away, not having seen their daughter in years.
			<br>
			<p>"I am a hero," she thought as blight ravaged the kingdom.
			<br>
			<p>"You are a hero," said the other wizards when her magic was fully gone.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>Only after the dragons came did she see, that they were not heroes. That she had not been a hero.
			<br>
			<p>Only after the ghost king and his ghost army and the most powerful ghost wizards failed to stop one from entering the capital did she see, that the ritual; which she had poured all of her magic, all of herself into; had not been rejuvenating the kingdom, but allowing it to stagnate. To rot.
			<br>
			<p>So filled was she with anger and despair, that she stormed back into the tower, armed only with a silver dagger and some powdered crystal, and when her way was blocked by wizards, she attacked them viciously.
			<br>
			<p>But they still had their powers while she did not, and captured her and shackled her and brought her to the dungeon and chained her to the phoenix's  cage, knowing that, unprotected by the runes, the ritual would kill her. The phoenix, with but few feathers remaining and scaly skin beneath, raw and red, looked almost exactly like a dragon now, but the girl found that she did not care.
			<br>
			<p>And so, resigned to her fate, the girl decided that even though she would die, she would also kill the corrupted bird, so that at least death's hold on her kingdom would be lessened.
			<br>
			<p>The wizards had taken her silver dagger, but had not found the crystalline dust, and the girl carefully spread it across the circles beneath her and hid her sabotage beneath her body. And when the time came and the ritual was cast, the magic was mis-channeled, and the hall was destroyed in a mass of raw power, and in the conflagration the girl and the phoenix died.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>The reborn phoenix flew from the burning pit of rubble and into the night sky; his savior riding upon his back.
			<br>
			<p>The girl looked back at the remains as the weight of her actions hit her. 
			<br>
			<p>And she cried.
			<br>
			<p>She had destroyed the tower that had been her home all these years. The tower that had kept her mentors and teachers and even some of her friends alive; or at least not fully dead. The rest were surely dead as well, given the size of the explosion.
			<br>
			<p>She cried for their loss. And she cried because she knew that she had still made the right choice; for so long as the tower kept the kingdom dead, it must be destroyed.
			<br>
			<p>And she cried because she knew that until things changed, until the kingdom was alive once more, she would need to make the choice again. And again. And again, still. 
			<br>
			<p>"Because I am a Hero", the girl cried. And the phoenix cried with her.
