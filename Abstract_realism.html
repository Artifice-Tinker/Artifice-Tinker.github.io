				<p>Abstractions built on objective reality are themselves objective.
				<br>
				<br>Let me ask you something. Do atoms objectively exist? Are atoms a real thing in the universe we live in? Yes? Okay, cool.
				<br>
				<br>Here's the important bit. I didn't ask "Do excitations in the fundamental fields which make up reality exist in pasterns which we call 'atoms' exist?" I asked "Do atoms exist?". And you said yes to that (I assume, I don't actually know that, if you didn't shoot me an email or something.)
				<br>
				<br>What this means is that if you take and objectively real thing, the excitations in the fundamental fields, and use your knowledge to create an abstraction to model it, the atom, that abstraction is itself objectively real (at least insofar as it actually is a good model of the thing). Hence the statement at the top: "Abstractions built on objective reality are themselves objective."
				<br>
				<br>The thing is, that statement is recursive.
				<br>
				<br>You can say that Physics is objective (insofar as it models base reality), and so you can also say that Chemistry is objective (insofar as it models the interactions of atomic particles in Physics). And so you can say that Organic Chemistry is objective (insofar as it models the interactions of various long chain molecules made from carbon and whatever). And so you can say that Biology is objective (insofar as it models the interactions of complex molecules which work in concert to maintain and reproduce themselves). And so on.
				<br>
				<br>All of these fields are objective (insofar as bla bla bla) because they are built on foundations that are themselves objective.
				<br>
				<br>An interesting outcome of this is things that are founded on multiple objective things.
				<br>
				<br>For example, Neurology is objective because it is built on the modeling of the probabilistic firings of particular biological structures in animals. But it is also objective because there's another field modeling virtual (abstract) objects built on the abstract understanding of the field of Computer Science, which is ultimately abstracted from the part of physics called Quantum Electrodynamics if we're talking tiny transistors. 
				<br>
				<br>Mathematics, then also exists objectively, because it shows up basically everywhere we try to make new abstractions. You can abstract basically any objective thing and get some kind of math out of it.
				<br>
				<br>Another interesting outcome of this is Psychology. 
				<br>
				<br>I would be absolutely shocked at this point if it turned out that there wasn't some predictable, and thus modellable, relation between the firings of the neurons in your brain and your subjective thoughts and experiences. Which means, counterintuitively, that your subjective experiences are in fact objectively real (though it is important to note that they exist on that layer of abstraction above neurology and not all the way down at fundamental physics so you still can't just get really high and rewrite reality).
				<br>
				<br>Ethics is not, as the classic philosophers considered, the  reasoning of a set of fundamental rules by which reality worked, or at least not precisely that. More, it is the study of what pro-social intuitions have been ingrained within the psyches of an overwhelming majority of humans (and potentially other agents given AI) by the various other abstract layers that have played a role in our developments.
				<br>
				<br>And finally, here's the most counterintuitive outcome of this ontology (or at least it was for me). 
				<br>
				<br>Magic, Mysticism, the Divine, the Supernatural, etc. all exist objectively (so long as they come with the understanding that they are psychological concepts and not metaphysical ones).
				<br>
				<br>Because despite my upbringing, and perhaps also yours, there are aspects of old and ancient and new age belief systems that are valuable for understanding our minds. 
				<br>
				<br>The difficulty of course, lies in determining which aspects of various religions and spiritualities those valuable aspects are, because they are also chock full of metaphysical bullshit, that their modern practitioners will tell you is intrinsic to every other aspect.
				<br>
				<br>I have found the work of John Vervaeke to be particularly useful here. 
				<br>
				<br>But your here on my website, and not his (for some inexplicable reason) so I am going to work to explain my personal thoughts about what aspects of various things are useful in much of the rest of this Philosophy section.
				<br>
				<br>If you remain unconvinced of the necessity of mythic thinking I have written most of my reasoning already in the Meta-page for <a href=kotd.html>The Kingdom of the Dead</a>. I will repeat those thoughts and add the other relevant ones in the post <a href=Mythic_thinking.html>On the Need for Mythic Thinking</a> </p>
