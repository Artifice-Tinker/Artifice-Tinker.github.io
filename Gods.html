				<p>You are going to have some thoughts about the idea when I speak of God or of Gods. That's okay, I have some thoughts about the idea too. That's what you're here for after all. So I'd ask you to put your own thoughts aside for the moment.
				<br>
				<br>Gods have historically preformed three important roles. They explain to a culture why the world exists the way it does. They unify a culture with shared rituals and traditions. And finally, they produce heroes and paragons that the culture emulates and reveres.
				<br>
				<br>Modernity has largely supplanted the first role, with it's scientific world view. The second is, probably the most important of the three right now, but I don't have a good theory of how to deal with the global fragmentation of culture right now, and it doesn't seem like anyone else does either given, you know, the state of the world. So uh, cut me some slack okay? I'm working on it.
				<br>
				<br>The third function is the one I want to focus on here.
				<br>
				<br>Greek myths will tell you that a hero is the son or daughter of some god or goddess by a mortal parent, or otherwise the direct descendant of that god through a mortal lineage. Other cultures will tell you that heroes are simply normal people with a particularly strong connection or devotion to a god of that culture.
				<br>
				<br>But gods are typically associated with a particular aspect of reality, or ideal, or mode of thought or action. In a more literal, less mythic sense, it seems to me that heroes were individuals who were particularly good  at actions seen as being within their patron god's domain, and who devoted themselves to improving those skills.
				<br>
				<br>But these heroes often were possesses of a kind of willpower and grit and resources which set them apart from mere practitioners, and allowed them to preform "heroic" deeds. Which is why we still know about them, instead of "Joe the pretty alright fisherman". 
				<br>
				<br>So, what is the nature of these gods and their heroes?
				<br>
				<br>I should clarify here, that when I use the terms "God" or "Gods" from here on, I will be referring to my own particular idea of a God within my Mythic Ontology. A God is specifically an abstraction built within human psychology. I am not talking about beings who control fundamental aspects of reality, I am talking about mental constructs; ones which can have significant power, but power over the stuff of minds and not of base reality.
				<br>
				<br>Gods are, fundamentally, entities running in the back of your head who you devote yourself towards; and who, in return, provide you with the willpower and determination you use to accomplish your shared goals.
				<br>
				<br>The willpower bit is why I have this attached to my writings <a href=Free_will.html>On Free Will</a>. The 12 step process seems to be at least somewhat effective and is heavily focused on one's relationship with "a higher power", at least as much as it is with a supportive community. And the whole field of existential philosophy, insofar as it makes any recommendations at all<sup onmouseover="footNote(this,'[^1]:');" onclick="footNote(this,'[^1]:');">[^1]</sup>, seems to be of the form "find something to devote yourself to" in the face of meaninglessness, or to counter it, or to produce your own meaning, or just to have something to do.
				<br>
				<br>The only requirement for an entity to be a god is that it be something you can devote yourself to, but there are two functional requirements to that.
				<br>
				<br>First, it needs to be something that you actually want. If you don't actually want it, like in your heart of hearts and not because society or whatever has told you that you should want it, then it's not going to be able to properly motivate you. You're just going to sit there feeling guilty that you aren't living up to the expectations you've set for yourself and wonder why you don't feel any of that free-will juice I've been talking about. That part is going to take some serious introspection. 
				<br>
				<br>Or maybe just some weed or shrooms or something idk. Anyway
				<br>
				<br>The second requirement is that it be coherent enough an entity in your head that you can figure out what it wants you to do. Like maybe you really do want to devote yourself to "World Peace", but like, how do you start doing anything about that? <sup onmouseover="footNote(this,'[^2]:') ;" onclick="footNote(this,'[^2]:');">[^2]</sup>
				<br>
				<br>Honestly I'm not sure why we would need something like a god to be psychologically healthy instead of becoming a depressed lump on the floor or whatever, aside from it practically never coming up in the ancestral environment. Like, until like 200 years ago, everyone would always have their tribe or god or kingdom to devote themselves to, and until like 30 years ago most everyone at least had their family they could devote themselves to. The individualism we're dealing with now is almost certainly a kind of hyper-novelty that we aren't adapted to. It feels like there's more to it than that tho. Idk.
				<br>
				<br>Anyway. There's one more important factor about gods in the abstract. To be devoted to a god, you must give it some degree of power over you. 
				<br>
				<br>In particular, it must be psychologically unpleasant for you to disregard your god's will. Because the point of having a god is to bolster your free will, and you wouldn't need it bolstered if you had the drive to do the thing on your own.
				<br>
				<br>And like, if you've gotten to the point where you've selected a god and it's telling you to do something, it's telling you that because *you* decided that it was a thing that you wanted to, in a roundabout way<sup onmouseover="footNote(this,'[^3]:');" onclick="footNote(this,'[^3]:');">[^3]</sup>. 
				<br>
				<br>Catholicism mostly does the unpleasantness by making you worry about being damned to hell for all eternity. Ancient religions are more about you and yours being smote by an angry god throwing a temper tantrum. Given the whole abstract realism thing, it's pretty obvious that your god doesn't actually have that kind of power (except maybe subconsciously?), but feeling like you've disappointed this "friend" of yours and broken a promise to them seems like it could be a powerful enough stick<sup onmouseover="footNote(this,'[^4]:');" onclick="footNote(this,'[^4]:');">[^4]</sup>.
				<br>
				<br>So, those are my basic thoughts on the idea of Gods. I've got more thoughts I'm working through right now obviously, but I don't think they're really ready to share yet.

					<p hidden id="[^1]:"> Damn  philosophers, never giving practical advice about abstract problems of reality.</p>
					<p hidden id="[^2]:"> This is actually one of the really clever things about Christianity. Like, the concept of a all powerful creator of the universe who wants you to follow his inscrutable plan is not an entity you can model, but Jesus was just some guy. You model "just some guy"-s all the time. Just imagine a guy who is the best guy you can imagine and that'll be close enough. #whatwouldjesusdo </p>
					<p hidden id="[^3]:"> There's some stuff that really should be said here about shadow work, but I haven't fully though that through yet. Probably look into Jungian Psychology? That's where I'd be taking most of it from anyway I imagine.</p>
					<p hidden id="[^4]:"> Don't forget the carrots though. Your god literally exists to help you do the things you want to do. They should be proud of you when you do good things!</p>
