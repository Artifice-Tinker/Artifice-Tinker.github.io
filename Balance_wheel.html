				<p>As part of ongoing projects, I've designed a small piece of jewelry based on a Balance Wheel.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A balance wheel is a small flywheel on a hairspring that bounces back and forth when flicked. In pocket watches or wrist watches it basically acts as the pendulum would in larger, stationary clocks.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Escapement is an assembly which regulates the unwinding of all movements connected to it's gear train by locking the teeth of the Escape Wheel. As it does so, it also pushes on the Balance Wheel, which bounces back and pushes back on the Escape Fork which unlocks the teeth, allowing the Escape Wheel to progress half a step. It is then locked by the other 'tine' of the Escape Fork, knocking the Balance Wheel again, repeating the cycle.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The way the hairspring coils and uncoils makes it look as though it is pulsing, which is why the Balance Wheel is called the heart of the watch.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I've designed a 3D printed version which makes the wheel and spring at the same time. There's a lot of interesting things you can do with printing, that you couldn't do otherwise. Hopefully I'll have a fully 3D printed clock in the near future.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Additionally, It makes a very satisfying fidget toy, which is why I'm selling them for 10$.</p>
