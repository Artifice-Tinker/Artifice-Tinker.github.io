			<p>Once upon a time, there was a kingdom. It was a wonderful kingdom, rich and beautiful. Everyone had warm houses and good food. They were protected by valiant knights and powerful wizards, and could live their lives to the fullest.
			<br>
			<p>The kingdom was so wonderful that all its people made a wish, that they could enjoy the goodness of the kingdom forever.
			<br>
			<p>This kingdom had, as many do, a prince. But unlike most princes, this one would never inherit the throne, for in this kingdom, his father, the king, would never truly die.
			<br>
			<p>And so the prince decided that if he would never be the king, he should make himself useful to the kingdom in another way. He turned away the lessons of rhetoric and statecraft and philosophy, and instead focused his studies on alchemy and magic, for he knew that there would always be a need for powerful wizards to maintain the spells which kept the kingdom.
			<br>
			<p>He learned from the best wizards in the land and was made apprentice to the great arch-wizard, who had crafted the spell which allowed the ghosts to flourish.
			<br>
			<p>Eventually the king passed, but he was secure in the knowledge that his son worked to maintain the spell which bound him to the kingdom.
			<br>
			<p>But keeping the spell working was not without cost, and the arch-mage, himself already old and weak, asked the prince to sacrifice some of his vitality to the spell. And of course, the prince accepted.
			<br>
			<p>And so seasons passed. 
			<br>
			<p>The prince aged quickly during this time but he learned even quicker, and eventually came to believe that he could make a spell even more grand than that of his master. And so the prince asked the king and the arch-mage, who was a ghost as well by this time, if he could take his leave. 
			<br>
			<p>And because the mage's tower had plenty of apprentices who could maintain the spell, and because the prince had worked diligently for all those years, they agreed and granted him a parcel of land in the west of the kingdom upon which he could build himself a grand wizard's tower.
			<br>
			<p>The prince found a site to build this tower atop a natural cave filled with crystals and rare metals and precious gemstones. From these resources, he crafted a nexus to hold his spell, and atop the tower he built a scrying pool, so that he could see it's results.
			<br>
			<p>The prince had made a spell to allow the magic in the kingdom to flow freely throughout so that it would not only congregate in the holy springs or in the stones beneath wizards' towers or in the blood of kings, but would instead be accessible by all.
			<br>
			<p>The prince cast his spell and it was a sight to behold.
			<br>
			<p>But the prince had grown old before his time, and he could feel the spell slowly killing him. But the prince knew that if he died, he would remain as a spirit, but much of his magic would leave him. And so the prince changed the runes of his nexus so that a portion of the magic would flow to him.
			<br>
			<p>And so seasons passed.
			<br>
			<p>And through them the prince maintained the spell. He did not eat, nor drink, nor sleep, and he wasted away till he was little more than a skeleton, but nor did he die, for he was sustained by the kingdom's magic.
			<br>
			<p>And he saw through his pool that everyone else had the kingdom's magic as well. And he saw how they used it. 
			<br>
			<p>Most did not understand the magic, and used it little, generally to make their lives simpler. Some understood it well and used it to wondrous effect. But as it became more and more common to use the magic, it became... less. More mundane. And people stopped noticing it.
			<br>
			<p>But the dragons did not.
			<br>
			<p>The dragons that had already been pillaging the kingdom were infused with the magic and grew quickly. New dragons emerged from the underground, awoken by the spell.
			<br>
			<p>The lich tried to fix his nexus, so that it would not empower the dragons but he could not think of a way to do so. He asked for help from the king, but the castle was under threat, and no knights could be spared. He asked for help from the arch-mage, but the ghost could think of nothing either.
			<br>
			<p>The only way to weaken the dragons was to stop the spell. But if that happened, the the lich would die, and the magic would never be perfected. And so he maintained the spell, no longer in control. And so the spell maintained him.
			<br>
			<p>And so seasons passed...
