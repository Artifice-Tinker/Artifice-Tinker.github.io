				<p>Alternate title: Why I am Bothering to Spend Any of my Time Writing Fairytales
				<br>
				<br>From <a href=kotd.html>The Kindgom of the Dead</a>:
				<br>
				<br>Our world is one of overwhelming complexity. Everything seems out of control, pushed around by titanic forces, indifferent at best and malicious at worst, playing games to their own inscrutable ends. 
				<br>
				<br>Catastrophes, local to regional to national to global, are mounting; expanding in frequency and destructive power. And the governing bodies and institutions which we might expect to be in control are blocked from action or asleep at the wheel, or paralyzed by gridlock, or even falling apart before our very eyes.
				<br>
				<br>These are problems of complexity; of systems adapted to their circumstances which fail when said circumstances change; of resources to be allocated in positive feedback loops and exponential growth which can only lead to larger collapse in the end; of interdependencies allowing cascading failures instead of isolated ones.
				<br>
				<br>But people generally aren't good at thinking about complex systems. In part because complexity science as a field is so new, and in part because we just aren't built for it. We're communal hairless apes for god's sake. We're made to sit around a campfire swapping stories, not considering if some societal intervention's long-term impacts are bad for some endangered species in some forest we've never been to.
				<br>
				<br>But we are good at stories. 
				<br>
				<br>And stories are complex. Elements interleave and themes interact and characters live and breathe, all aligning to complex patterns of narrative and archetypal significance, and all of that is understood by us, intuitively. Because we're made to sit around a campfire swapping stories.
				<br>
				<br>---
				<br>
				<br>There's a saying I've heard from a man called Jim Rutt, which paraphrased is something like, "Because of the slow and haphazard nature of evolution, our minds are, to within some small degree of approximation, the stupidest things that are mentally capable of building a global civilization." And being able to build one does not even necessarily entail being about to sustain one, so we might be fucked anyway.
				<br>
				<br>If Dunbar was right, we are capable of consciously modeling the minds of somewhere around 150 people, or the people of about 2 or 3 tribes including our own. In a world of 7000000000 people, of multiple nations of 100000000 people, of our *small* towns having 1000 people, that is woefully insufficient.
				<br>
				<br>However, even though our biology hasn't been able to adapt within the short 10000 years it's had since agriculture produced nations, our culture has. 
				<br>
				<br>To some extent. 
				<br>
				<br>Mostly with violence, but we'll try to work on that.
				<br>
				<br>The point is, the psychotechnologies that human culture has developed to be able to deal with those things that could not be handled directly by consciousness was to encode those things in myth. This includes those things like natural systems that could not be understood due to a lack of scientific rigor, which leads to those unfortunate metaphysical claims all over the place, but it also includes those things like the sociological causes of historical events (see https://youtu.be/cki-9ANZTLg), and recipes for herbal medicine, and plausibly effective psychotherapeutic techniques, in addition to all the xenophobia and genocide and all that. Which, I mean, culturally understandable when you're surrounded by other xenophobic gynocidal nutcases.
				<br>
				<br>Gods and Heroes and Monsters and Spirits and Rituals in ancient myths and religions play a large number of roles in the transmission of culture stable enough to survive the generations in some form or another into the modern day.
				<br>
				<br>There are some things we can know about the world, and about what conditions are necessary for our success, even with only the knowledge derived by modern means. However, given the current state of the world, I expect that our methods have not become sufficiently developed to protect us from disaster.
				<br>
				<br>If only we had access to another source of knowledge about dealing with personal, interpersonal, and societal problems, which had undergone some form of memetic evolution over a long period of time OH WAIT!
				<br>
				<br>---
				<br>
				<br>So, given all that stuff above, my goals for my philosophical projects are twofold. 
				<br>
				<br>1. I want to try to understand the values encoded into various systems of supernatural, mythic beliefs to a sufficient degree that I can explain them using modern language, including a precise understanding of how they effect various things at the relevant (largely psychological or sociological) layers of abstraction. 
				2. I want to be able to encode complex ideas about our modern world into mythic language, so as to allow people a more intuitive understanding of the problems we face, and some of their potential solutions; generally in the form of my fairytales (see the kingdom of the dead).
				<br>
				<br>In order for me to do all that though, I need to have a strong grounding in my understanding of the subjective experience of mind.
				<br>
				<br>I believe that the place to start that understanding is in the topic of Free Will. See <a href=Free_will.html>On Free Will</a></p>
