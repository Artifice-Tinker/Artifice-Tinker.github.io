			<p>Once upon a time, there was a kingdom. It was a kingdom in decline. The rulers had cast a spell upon the land which prevented some who died from passing, and so it continued on, maintained by what prosperity remained from the time before.</p>
			 
			<p>In this kingdom was an aspiring young wizard. He believed in the kingdom and it's stories, that the ghosts had told him; of the glory of the kingdom, of the goodness that wizardry had done for them all, of the need for yet more wizards and the venerated place they held.</p>
			 
			<p>And so the apprentice had studied the ways of sorcery, the history of wizardry, and the laws of magic that governed the fundamental reality his kingdom inhabited, and he scoffed at the very idea of gods and demons and spirits that the old mystics and priests had worshiped and feared and called upon in the days before the kingdom had learned better.</p>
			 
			<p>"It is wizardry that made the kingdom great, after all," the wizened ghosts said, "Why must we worship gods when it is obvious our power now outstrips their own. If they even have any real power at all"</p>
			 
			<p>And so the neophyte became learned in the ways of sorcery and when the time came to choose a specialization he learned the craft of golemancy, for that was the school that had constructed the most powerful magics in recent times, despite the relative stagnation of the kingdom as a whole.</p>
			 
			<p>But although the apprentice had great aptitude for understanding how the runes and circles interacted such that a non-living form could be made as to think and move and act, and a certain skill for the academic problems his mentors tasked him with, he found that he had little patience for the mundane tasks nobles would bring to his master's tower and would allow other students the opportunity to gain prestige while he focused on his studies.</p>
			 
			<p>He believed the stories of the kingdom, after all, that if you had sufficient skill, the kingdom would grant you all that you would need to see it flourish; and also that true skill was found in arcane knowledge, and not beholden to the monetary whims of others.</p>
			 
			<p>Eventually though, his absentminded master deemed him sufficiently prepared and he was granted the title of journeyman to make his way in the world. Whereupon he found that no one was willing to act as his patron, as he had built no repour. </p>
			 
			<p>And so he floundered uselessly for a time, unable to afford the gems and reagents required by his craft.</p>
			 
			<p>As plagues and dragons befell the kingdom, the failed wizard came to understand that the stories he had believed were only stories, and that the kingdom was fundamentally broken. </p>
			 
			<p>Despite that though, it was only in desperation that he became willing to seek out the work that the kingdom called menial; and he gained employment as a janitor; cleaning the floors of a small, run down library in the capital. </p>
			 
			<p>He slept poorly in a dingy cellar in a nearby hovel until the sun set and then trudged to work, and when he was done he trudged back home, shut the door, and went back to sleep; lacking the energy to do anything else, despite being weighed down only by the clothes on his back and the simple tools of his new trade. As well as all the unfulfilled potential he carried with him, of course. That was certainly the heaviest of the three. </p>
			 
			<p>His only other possession of any note was a small keepsake from his parents.</p>
			 
			<p>His parents had given him a small looking glass with a small enchantment. They had understood the value of understanding and precision in arcane knowledge, and so, before the young wizard had gone off to his master's tower, they had it enchanted it to reflect light on things that shone more about them that was truer than not.</p>
			 
			<p>Now though, when he tried to reflect it upon any of the storybooks he found in the library, or on any runes he had carved in his time between labor and rest, they were made darker than the candlelight illuminating the room.</p>
			 
			<p>He found this behavior strange, and with his expertise only tangentially related he had little idea what might be causing the enchantment to fail.</p>
			 
			<p>And so he obsessed over finding an answer to his puzzle with the resources he had at hand and his obsession filled him with a kind of vigor that could, for a time, keep his depression at bay.</p>
			 
			<p>He found in the old library, treatises on a strange phenomenon where mirrors all around the kingdom seemed to have grown darker and speculations as to why; and journals countering the claim, saying that all the mirrors they had looked at were the same as ever and that the phenomena was all in people's heads.</p>
			 
			<p>The case of the opposition was all the stronger, for the treatises were largely written by priests and mystics who still considered the old ways to be "correct". Whatever that might mean.</p>
			 
			<p>One day however, in a small courtyard near the library, he overheard a conversation between two wizards, both of whom seemed to be taking as granted that things were dimmer, but who were speaking with a precision that only modern sages could.</p>
			 
			<p>Fascinated, and hiding in the bushes, the janitor took fervent notes as to the topics they discussed, the hypotheses they put forth, the authors they cited, and so on; and later he would seek out what he could find on it all within the old library. </p>
			 
			<p>And he continued to do this week after week, until the wizards eventually decided to take their conversation to one of their towers, that they might refine it further in a more focused and secluded manner. </p>
			 
			<p>This saddened the janitor but it did not deter him, for he had learned from them most all of what he felt he needed.</p>
			 
			<p>The mages had spoken of an early branch of wizardry, concerned primarily with bewitchments of the mind, which had been heavily reliant on a primitive understanding of spirits, in the time before wizards had discounted the idea in favor of other, stronger theories.</p>
			 
			<p>These wizards however, and the authors they cited, spoke of those ideas with the precision of experimentation they had previously lacked, about the nature of the realm of spirits. </p>
			 
			<p>They had noticed, for example, that spirits were only visible when one was actively seeking them, but completely invisible under firelight, or the light of the sun, unless bound by a summoner. They had also noticed that the spirits would only interact with the individual they chose. Finally, they found that they would turn into any of a variety of monster if kept languishing in shadow for to long.</p>
			 
			<p>Modern priests would consider their views heretical; most mystics and wizards both, would decry it as fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of reality, though for very different reasons.</p>
			 
			<p>It was understandable to the janitor though, that they would all have not seen these aspects of the world properly:</p>
			 
			<p>Priests were uncompromising in their devotion to their gods, and their gods would not accept the summoning of spirits in the first place, save for those that served their exacting purposes.</p>
			 
			<p>Mystics would preform their rituals only at night, for now obvious reasons; and they agreed that spirits would become monstrous, though they were less clear on the cause; but mostly they believed the spirits to be fit for any and all purposes, even while other forms of wizardry were clearly superior for most practical needs.</p>
			 
			<p>Finally, wizards fundamentally misunderstood the nature of spirits, doing their work in dark, gloomy towers, lit only by candles and orbs of solar magic, and had come to the conclusion that spirits were simply a kind of particularly powerless ghost, given only the descriptions the other groups had provided, and could be safely ignored.</p>
			 
			<p>The janitor took his new knowledge and decided to see if he could understand what was wrong with his mirror, and so, under the light of the next full moon, he observed what it had to show.</p>
			 
			<p>Wherever he turned it he found spirits of misery suffusing the kingdom. There were other spirits too, of course: </p>
			 
			<p>The nobles had somehow erected a barrier of some sort around their castles, with all their gold and magic, probably unintentionally, given how it seemed to be leaking. </p>
			 
			<p>Glimmers of happiness, of contentment, of grit and determination could be found in patches and pockets throughout the city, and the church's gods protected their followers somewhat.</p>
			 
			<p>This certainly accounted for the dimming of the mirrors, but he found the most terrifying spirit of all, only after he was finished for the night, and had returned to the cellar that was his home.</p>
			 
			<p>He was normally working when the moon was out, after all, or else bathed his bedroom in candlelight to read by. </p>
			 
			<p>But this time, when the tired janitor opened the door into his darkened room, he found orange eyes staring at him, belonging to the form of a giant black dog; a giant <i>hungry</i> black dog.</p>
			 
			<p>For a moment, the man almost turned to run; run all through the night, until the sun rose to banish the fell creature, but through his research he knew that that would do little but delay the inevitable. It had been left in the dark for far too long, and would surely hunt him where ever he fled, sunlight or no.</p>
			 
			<p>So instead, he did as the mystics of old had recommended, and he prepared to try and wrestle the great beast to the ground, though he knew he would certainly loose that battle and be killed all the same.</p>
			 
			<p>However, as he raised his hands, bringing what magics he still held to bare, the light of his mirror glinted across the monster's face, and in that moment, the wizard saw a determination in the beast's eyes. A determination not born out of insatiable hunger or vengeful malice, but a strange kind of protectiveness.</p>
			 
			<p>The beast had not torn him to shreds yet, despite the many moons it must have had to do so while he was yet unaware. And it had not yet done so now despite his, by now, sluggish and confused reaction.</p>
			 
			<p>In the same moment he relaxed, dismissing the magic he had nearly loosed at the animal, it was on him, its massive jaws closing around his body.</p>
			 
			<p>But somehow, the wizard was unharmed. The beast tore off into the night firmly carrying the wizard in its maw, but with a surprising gentleness about it.</p>
			 
			<p>It seemed to the wizard that what this spirit had wanted most of all was simply to do something, anything, because it could. For the wizard to do something. Because he could.</p>
			 
			<p>It had been with him since he failed to find his place as a mage, and had decided to languish in the dark. It had eaten his energy in a mistaken, unfortunate attempt to push him back into his drive.</p>
			 
			<p>Because, despite everything, in his heart of hearts, he knew that he could still be a great wizard.</p>
			 
			<p>The man, still riding in the beasts jaws, the two of them tearing through the sleeping city, let loose the laugh of a mad man, with a frenzy that would hold off the gathering of the other saddened spirits around them for moons to come.</p>
			 
			<p>After a time, the dog trotted to a stop and released the wizard from it's mouth. They had found themselves to a hill on the other side of the city, in time to watch the moon set and the sky change hue.</p>
			 
			<p>The man pet his loyal hound and asked it if would stay by his side. And being among the goodest of boys, the dog licked his face until the sun began peaking over the horizon.</p>
			 
			<p>The wizard cut a loop of cloth from his shirt, and put it around the spirit's neck, and with a flourish of magic, it transformed into a collar. Just as the beast disappeared alongside the morning dew.</p>
			 
			<p>The summoner smiled at his tattered shirt and began his long walk back home. He would need to make some changes, he decided. But finally, once again, he had taken that first step to becoming a great wizard.
