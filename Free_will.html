				<p>The most prevalent definitions of free will are bad. The competing theories of free will, which you will learn about in any philosophy class, are Libertarian Free Will, and Determinism.
				<br>
				<br>Libertarian Free Will posits that people are able to choose to do different things, even when the starting conditions (including their own) are the same. And because people are free, there is some fundamental part of being a person that makes you not fully beholden to deterministic causality.
				<br>
				<br>Determinism thinks that Libertarian Free Will is dumb and stupid, because when we look at brains, we don't see any kind of weird "free will" particle bouncing around and making neurons do things classical mechanics wouldn't expect them too. We can look really, really close and see weird quantum things going on, but those same things are going on everywhere so if we say that that's free will, we have to say that *everything* is a person.
				<br>
				<br>The deterministic critique of the libertarian position is correct. Brains follow causality just the same as everything else, and I don't think the panpsychists have a good enough explanation of mind stuff to just say "yes everything behaves exactly like you'd expect it to if it were just mater, but it's all actually experiencing things. For reasons".
				<br>
				<br>The thing is though, determinism is also dumb and stupid, because they say that free will is just a dumb, stupid idea that is logically impossible, and any feeling you have about making choices is your brain lying to you. Now let me explain why that's a dumb and stupid thing to say. Because I am so smart.
				<br>
				<br>Those theories are defining things in such a way that it's either trivially true, or fundamentally impossible. That isn't a good way of defining things typically. Normally we define descriptors so that they can apply to some things it could have applied to, and also not to others.
				<br>
				<br>Like, "blue" is a useful descriptor because there are things that are blue, and other things that are not blue. "Blue" doesn't just uniformly point at all objects with color. But for some reason "Free will" points at all objects that are people? Why not just say people, then?
				<br>
				<br>More importantly though, the theories are defining things in terms of "physics stuff" to explain how things work. But if you look at the idea of free will through my super cool <a href=Abstract_realism.html>Abstract Realism</a> thing, it's pretty obvious that whatever-the-heck we're trying to talk about here is a description of "mind stuff", not "physics stuff". They're arguing at the wrong layer of abstraction. Like what the heck would it even look like for a particle to have free will? It's just not a coherent idea.
				<br>
				<br>Its the definition they're using for free will is the problem; why the two sides are just talking past each other. So let me put forward a better one.
				<br>
				<br><blockquote>A mind has free will if and only if, when it decides it ought to pursue some result, it will act in a way it believes will bring about that result. 
				<br>
				<br>The extent to which a mind cannot act to pursue a desired result, is the extent to which it lacks free will. </blockquote>
				<br>
				<br>This is a definition that actually means something. It makes a claim about minds and only minds that manages to point in the same general direction that people typically gesture towards when talking about free will, and it can describe what a lack of free will would be like.
				<br>
				<br>But I choose this definition in particular, because it is useful in real situations to conceptualize one's state of mind. In particular, I think it is useful for understanding addiction and depression.
				<br>
				<br>To be in the grips of addiction or depression to a substance is to lack some degree of free will. You may decide that you should not take your drug of choice, but that decision does not necessarily mean that you won't. You may decide that you should go work on you projects or hang out with friends or do literally anything at all other than lay in bed, but that decision also does not mean that you will.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>Given all that, the next obvious question is "how can one strengthen their free will?"
